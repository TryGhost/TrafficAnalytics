# Traffic Analytics

Traffic Analytics Service - A web analytics proxy for Ghost that processes and enriches traffic data before forwarding it to Tinybird's analytics API.

## Features

- User agent parsing for OS, browser, and device detection
- Referrer URL parsing and categorization
- Privacy-preserving user signatures with daily-rotating salts
- Configurable salt storage (in-memory or Firestore)
- Docker-first development with Firestore emulator support

## Configuration

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure as needed:

- `PORT` - Server port (default: 3000)
- `LOG_LEVEL` - Logging level (default: info)
- `PROXY_TARGET` - Upstream URL to forward requests (default: http://localhost:3000/local-proxy)
- `SALT_STORE_TYPE` - Salt store implementation: memory or firestore (default: memory)
- `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT` - Google Cloud project ID for Firestore (required when using firestore salt store)
- `LOG_PROXY_REQUESTS` - Enable logging of proxy requests (default: true)
- `ENABLE_SALT_CLEANUP_SCHEDULER` - Enable automatic daily salt cleanup (default: true)
- `FIRESTORE_DATABASE_ID` - Firestore database ID (required when using firestore salt store)
- `PUBSUB_TOPIC_PAGE_HITS_RAW` - Pub/Sub topic for raw page hits (required for pub/sub functionality)
- `TRUST_PROXY` - Enable trust proxy to resolve client IPs from X-Forwarded-For headers (default: true)

## Develop

1. `git clone` this repo & `cd` into it as usual
2. Run `yarn` to install top-level dependencies.

## Build
- `yarn build` to transpile Typescript to JS
- `docker compose build` to build docker image

## Run

- `yarn dev` start development server in docker compose (includes Firestore, Pub/Sub emulator)
- View: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Run locally with Ghost in Docker

Sometimes it's useful to test the full setup with Ghost pointing its tracker script to this analytics service running locally. The setup is a bit painful, but it is possible:
- In the Ghost repo, run `yarn tb` to run Tinybird local
- Ensure your Ghost configuration is setup to point to the local tinybird instance â€” i.e. `tinybird:stats:local:enabled` and `tinybird:tracker:local:enabled` should be true, with the appropriate endpoints set.
- In your `tb` shell, run `tb token ls` to list your local tokens
    - Copy the tracker token, and set it as `tinybird:tracker:local:token` in your Ghost config
    - Also add this to your `.env` file in this repo
    - Copy the `stats_page` token and set it as `tinybird:stats:local:token` in your Ghost config
- Set your `tinybird:tracker:local:endpoint` config to `http://localhost:3000/tb/web_analytics`, which will point the `ghost-stats` script to your local analytic service
- In your `.env` file in this repo, set the `PROXY_TARGET=http://host.docker.internal:7181/v0/events` to point the analytics service to your `tb-local` container

To test the setup: 
- load your local Ghost site's frontend in your browser. You should see a successful POST request to `/tb/web_analytics`
- Run `tb datasource data analytics_events` in your `tb` shell, and you should see your new pageview event

## Test

- `yarn test` run all tests in docker compose

## Lint
- `yarn lint` run eslint in docker compose

## Multi-Worktree Development

This project supports running multiple worktrees simultaneously using Docker Compose. Each worktree can run its own isolated development environment with unique ports and container names.

### Setup

1. **Create worktrees** as usual with git worktree
2. **Configure each worktree** with a unique `.env` file:

```bash
# main worktree (.env) - uses defaults
NODE_ENV=development

# work worktree (.env)  
NODE_ENV=development
COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=traffic-analytics-work
ANALYTICS_PORT=3001
FIRESTORE_PORT=8081

# scratch worktree (.env)
NODE_ENV=development  
COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=traffic-analytics-scratch
ANALYTICS_PORT=3002
FIRESTORE_PORT=8082
```

### Usage

Each worktree runs completely isolated:
- **Unique ports**: No conflicts between worktrees
- **Isolated containers**: Auto-generated names like `traffic-analytics-work-analytics-service-1`
- **Separate volumes**: Each worktree has its own `node_modules` volume
- **Independent projects**: Services can run simultaneously

```bash
# Start development in any worktree
cd /path/to/worktree
docker compose up

# Each worktree accessible on its configured port
# main: http://localhost:3000
# work: http://localhost:3001  
# scratch: http://localhost:3002
```

## Deployment

Merging to `main` automatically deploys to staging. Production deployments only happen when the version in `package.json` changes.

To ship to production:
1. `yarn ship` - creates a release branch with version bump
2. Create PR using the provided link
3. Merge the PR - this triggers production deployment
